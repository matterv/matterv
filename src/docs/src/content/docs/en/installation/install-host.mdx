This guide provides step-by-step instructions for installing MatterV Host. There are two installation methods available: network installation and offline installation.

## Network Installation (Recommended)
The network installation method is the simplest way to install MatterV Host. It automatically downloads and installs the latest version.
* Run the installation command:

```shell
curl -fsSL https://www.matterv.com/release/matterv-host/latest | sudo bash -
```

* Wait for the installation to complete. The installer will:
  * Download the latest MatterV Host package
  * Install required dependencies
  * Configure system settings
  * Start the MatterV Host service

## Offline Installation
Use this method when the server doesn't have internet access or when you need to install a specific version.

* Download the installation package:
  * On a machine with internet access, visit: [MatterV Host Release](https://www.matterv.com/release/matterv-host/latest)
  * Download the MatterV Host package (example: matterv-host-0.6.tgz)

* Transfer the package:

  * Copy the downloaded package to your MatterV Host server
  * Ensure you have sufficient permissions in the destination directory

* Install MatterV Host:
  ```shell
  # Extract the package
  tar xzf matterv-0.6.tgz

  # Run the installer
  bash ./installer -l matterv-0.6.tgz
  ```

* Verifying the Installation
After installation is complete, verify that MatterV Host is running properly:
  ```shell
  systemctl status matterv-host
  ```
  The output should show that the service is "active (running)". For example:
  ```text

       Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/matterv-host.service; enabled; vendor preset: disabled)
