This guide will help you understand the platform architecture and prepare for installation.
:::tip[Before you begin]
Before starting installation, ensure you have reviewed all system requirements and completed the pre-installation checklist.

## Platform Overview

MatterV platform consists of two main components:

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="MatterV Cluster" icon="laptop">
    The management and orchestration component that controls and monitors all MatterV Hosts
  </Card>
  <Card title="MatterV Host" icon="server">
    The hypervisor component that runs virtual machines on physical servers
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Deployment Options

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Production Environment">
    ### Production Environment (Recommended)

    In production environments, we recommend installing MatterV Cluster and MatterV Host on separate machines:

    #### MatterV Cluster
    - Install on a dedicated management server
    - Requires only one cluster instance per environment
    - Manages multiple MatterV Hosts

    #### MatterV Host
    - Install on each physical server that will run virtual machines
    - Can be installed on multiple hosts
    - All hosts are managed by a single MatterV Cluster
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Test Environment">
    ### Test/Evaluation Environment

    For testing or evaluation purposes, you can install both components on a single machine:
    - Requires higher system specifications (combines both component requirements)
    - Suitable for proof of concept or learning environment
    - Not recommended for production use
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## System Requirements

### MatterV Cluster Requirements
| Component | Minimum Requirement |
| ---- | --- |
| **Operating System** | RHEL 9.5, Rocky Linux 9.5, or AlmaLinux 9.5 |
| **Storage** | 20GB free disk space |
| **Memory** | 8GB RAM |
| **CPU** | x86 architecture, 8 cores

### MatterV Host Requirements

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="System">
    | Component | Minimum Requirement |
    |-----------|-------------------|
    | Operating System | RHEL 9.5, Rocky Linux 9.5, or AlmaLinux 9.5 |
    | Memory | 16GB RAM |
    | CPU | x86 architecture, 8 cores |
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Storage">
    ### Recommended Storage Layout

    MatterV Host requires a specific disk partition layout for optimal performance and management:

    | Partition | Minimum Size | Recommended Size | Purpose |
    |-----------|-------------|------------------|---------|
    | OS Partition (`/`) | 20GB | 50GB | Operating system and MatterV Host software |
    | Data Partition (`/mnt`) | 100GB | 500GB+ | Virtual machine storage, images, and snapshots |

    :::caution[Storage Planning]
    The data partition size should be planned according to:
    - Number of VMs you plan to host
    - Size of VM disk images
    - Snapshot requirements
    - Future growth expectations
    :::

    #### Example Partition Layout
    ```bash
    # Example partition layout for a 1TB drive
    /dev/sda1    /boot        1GB
    /dev/sda2    /            50GB     # OS partition
    /dev/sda3    swap         16GB     # Equal to RAM size
    /dev/sda4    /mnt    Remaining space     # Data partition
    ```

    :::note
    For production environments, we recommend using LVM (Logical Volume Management) for flexible storage management and future expansion.

### Combined Installation Requirements (Test/Evaluation)
| Component | Minimum Requirement |
| ---- | --- |
| **Operating System** | RHEL 9.5, Rocky Linux 9.5, or AlmaLinux 9.5 |
| **Storage** | 40GB free disk space |
| **Memory** | 24GB RAM |
| **CPU** | x86 architecture, 16 cores

### Pre-Installation Checklist
Before proceeding with the installation, ensure:

* Operating System
  * Verify you have a clean installation of one of the supported operating systems
  * Ensure the system is updated to the latest packages

* Hardware Verification
  * For MatterV Host, verify virtualization is enabled:
```shell
# Check if CPU supports virtualization
grep -E 'vmx|svm' /proc/cpuinfo

# Verify virtualization is enabled in BIOS/UEFI
lsmod | grep kvm
```

* Network Requirements

  * Ensure network connectivity between cluster and host components (if installing separately)

## Installation Order
* Install and configure MatterV Cluster first
* Install MatterV Host(s)
* Connect hosts to the cluster

## Next Steps
After confirming all requirements are met, proceed to:
