This guide provides step-by-step instructions for installing MatterV Cluster. There are two installation methods available: network installation and offline installation.

## Network Installation (Recommended)
The network installation method is the simplest way to install MatterV Host. It automatically downloads and installs the latest version.
* Run the installation command:

```shell
curl -fsSL https://github.com/matterv/matterv/releases/download/v0.7.0/install-matterv-cluster.sh | sudo bash -
```

* Wait for the installation to complete. The installer will:
* Download the latest MatterV Cluster package
* Install required dependencies
* Configure system settings
* Start the MatterV Cluster service

## Offline Installation
Use this method when the server doesn't have internet access or when you need to install a specific version.

* Download the installation package:
* On a machine with internet access, visit: [MatterV Cluster Release](https://github.com/matterv/matterv/releases/tag/v0.7.0)
* Download the MatterV Cluster package (example: matterv-cluster-0.7.0.tar.xz)

* Transfer the package:

* Copy the downloaded package to your MatterV Cluster server
* Ensure you have sufficient permissions in the destination directory

* Install MatterV Cluster:
```shell
# Extract the package
tar xzf matterv-cluster-0.7.0.tar.xz

# Run the installer
bash ./installer -l matterv-cluster-0.7.0.tar.xz
  ```

## Verifying the Installation
After installation is complete, verify that MatterV Cluster is running properly:
```shell
systemctl status matterv-cluster
  ```
The output should show that the service is "active (running)". For example:
```text
matterv-cluster.service - Matterv Cluster Service
     Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/matterv-cluster.service; enabled; preset: disabled)
     Active: active (running) since Sat 2024-12-07 12:47:13 PST; 11s ago

  ```
