# Configuring Network for MatterV Host

After installing MatterV Host, you need to configure the network that will be used by virtual machines. This guide explains the network model and configuration process.

## Network Model

MatterV Host currently supports a simple network model called "Basic Network":

- **Basic Network**: A single network where all VMs can communicate with each other
- Only one basic network is supported per MatterV host
- VLANs are not supported in the current version
- The network is implemented using Linux bridge

:::note[Limitations]
- Only one basic network can be configured per host
- VLAN support will be added in future releases
:::

## Physical Network Interface

Before configuring the basic network, you need to identify which physical network interface will be used.

<Steps>
  1. List available network interfaces using `ip`
  2. Review the output to identify available interfaces
  3. Choose one physical interface for the basic network
  4. Note the chosen interface name (e.g., ens192)
</Steps>

Example `ip addr` output:
```bash
[root@localhost ~]# ip addr
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 ::1/128 scope host
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
2: ens192: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 00:0c:29:1d:32:58 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    altname enp11s0
    inet 192.168.1.116/24 brd 192.168.1.255 scope global dynamic noprefixroute ens192
       valid_lft 85300sec preferred_lft 85300sec
    inet6 2600:1700:38ce:c020:20c:29ff:fe1d:3258/64 scope global dynamic noprefixroute
       valid_lft 3488sec preferred_lft 3488sec
    inet6 fe80::20c:29ff:fe1d:3258/64 scope link noprefixroute
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever

```

:::caution[Network Selection]
If your host has multiple NICs, you can only use one for the basic network. Choose your network interface carefully, as it will be reconfigured and temporarily disconnected during bridge setup.
:::

## Creating Basic Network

Once you've identified the physical network interface, follow these steps to create the basic network:

- Run the setup script with your chosen network interface:
```bash
sudo bash /opt/matterv/host/scripts/setup_bridge.sh -b virbr0 -p ens192
```
- Wait for the script to complete (network will be interrupted briefly)
- Verify the bridge creation: `ip link show virbr0`

:::danger[Network Interruption]
Running the setup script will temporarily interrupt the network connection on the specified interface for a few seconds. Plan accordingly and ensure you have alternative access if needed.
:::

## After Configuration

When the setup is complete:
- A new bridge interface `virbr0` will be created
- The physical interface will be added to the bridge
- VMs can now be configured to use this network
- The host's original IP address will be moved to the bridge interface
