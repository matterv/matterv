# MatterV 0.7.0 Release

We’re thrilled to announce the release of **MatterV 0.7.0**, a major milestone for our VM management tool. This release introduces a **breakthrough feature: VMware-Compatible Mode**, which allows MatterV to emulate VMware environments seamlessly. Let’s dive into what this means for you.

## What’s New in MatterV 0.7.0?

### VMware-Compatible Mode
MatterV now supports **VMware-Compatible Mode**, enabling your guest VMs to behave just like VMware VMs. This means:
- You can install **VMware Tools** inside your VMs.
- Your VMs will recognize MatterV as a VMware hypervisor.

#### What Does This Mean for Customers?
1. **Transfer Your VMware Knowledge**: If you’re familiar with VMware, you can now use that knowledge with MatterV. No need to learn new tools or processes.
2. **Protect Your Investment**: Any custom scripts, configurations, or workflows you’ve built for VMware will continue to work seamlessly on MatterV.
3. **Pave the Way for Migration**: This release sets the stage for our next major update, where you’ll be able to **migrate VMware VMs to MatterV natively**. Simply copy data from your vCenter to MatterV, and everything will work without manual modifications or guest VM credentials.

#### Why Choose MatterV for Migration?
- **Worry-Free Migration**: If anything goes wrong during migration, your original VMware VMs remain intact and fully functional.
- **Seamless Process**: Just a few clicks, and your VMs are ready to go on MatterV. No other company offers this level of simplicity and reliability.
