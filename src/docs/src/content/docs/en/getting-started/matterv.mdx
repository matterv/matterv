MatterV is an open-source Virtual Machine management platform built on RHEL/AlmaLinux. It provides streamlined VM management with focus on usability, reliability, and performance.

## Core Features
* **Modern User Interface**: Clean, minimalist design with responsive layouts, dark/light themes, and streamlined workflows that simplify VM management for both novice and advanced users.
* **Automated upgrades**: Unified upgrade system that updates all components (hypervisor, management tools, OS) with a single click, ensuring seamless version compatibility and forward upgrade path.
* **Performance Optimization**: Smart resource management system that dynamically allocates compute resources based on real-time usage patterns and workload demands.
* **Enterprise Linux Foundation**: Built on RHEL/AlmaLinux for 10+ year support lifecycle, extensive hardware compatibility including legacy systems, and enterprise-grade stability with minimal resource requirements.


## Architecture

### MatterV Cluster

A centralized management layer that orchestrates multiple MatterV hosts, providing:
* Unified management interface
* Resource allocation across hosts
* High availability coordination
* Centralized monitoring and control

### MatterV Hosts
Individual compute nodes that:
* Run virtual machines
* Handle local resource management
* Connect to the central cluster for coordination
* Operate independently if cluster connection is lost

### Communication Flow
* Cluster broadcasts management decisions
* Hosts report status and metrics
* Inter-host communication for live migration
* Automatic failover coordination


## High Availability

### Host Failure
* VMs automatically migrate to healthy hosts
* Resources redistributed automatically

### Network Partition

#### Host-Cluster Partition
* VMs continue running without interruption
* Host maintains full local management capability
* All VM operations (start/stop/restart) remain available
* Host automatically resynchronizes when connection restores

#### Host-Host Partition
* Each host continues operating independently
* Local VMs remain fully functional
* No impact on VM performance or availability
* Automatic state reconciliation upon network recovery

#### Complete Network Isolation
* Host maintains all critical operations
* VMs run at full performance
* Local management interface remains accessible
* No dependency on external connectivity
