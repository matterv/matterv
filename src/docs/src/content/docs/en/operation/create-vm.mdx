# Creating Virtual Machine

This guide walks you through the process of creating a new virtual machine (VM) in MatterV.

## Prerequisites
- MatterV Host is configured and connected
- Storage is set up and available
- Network is configured
- ISO image is uploaded for OS installation

## Creating a New VM

<Steps>
  1. Navigate to "Instances" page
  2. Click the "Create Instance" button
  3. Enter a name for your virtual machine
  4. Set number of CPU cores
  5. Set memory size (in GB)
  6. Select guest OS type (Windows or Linux)
  7. Choose a host for VM placement
  8. Click "Add a disk" and select storage location
  9. Set disk size (repeat if multiple disks needed)
  10. Click "Choose An ISO" and select your OS installation image
  11. Click "Add a network" and select your network
  12. Click "Submit" to create the VM
</Steps>

## Configuration Reference

### Basic Settings

| Setting | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| VM Name | Unique identifier for your VM | `web-server-01` |
| CPU Cores | Number of virtual CPU cores | `2` cores |
| Memory | Amount of RAM allocated | `4` GB |
| Guest OS | Operating system type | Windows or Linux |
| Host | Physical server for VM placement | `host-01` |

### Storage Tips
- Create multiple disks if needed (e.g., separate system and data disks)
- Ensure enough free space in storage pool
- Consider OS requirements for minimum disk size

### Network Configuration
Your VM will use the basic network configured on the host (typically `virbr0`).



## After VM Creation

The VM will be created and started automatically within a few seconds. Once running, you have several management options:

### Accessing the VM Console

<Steps>
  1. Find your VM in the instances list
  2. Click the "Console" button
  3. A new browser tab will open showing the VM's display
  4. You can now interact with the VM directly through your browser
</Steps>

:::tip[Console Access]
The console provides direct access to your VM, similar to having a physical monitor connected. This is particularly useful during OS installation or when you need direct access to the system.

### Basic VM Controls

<Steps>
  1. Locate your VM in the instances list
  2. Use the control buttons to: Stop the VM (graceful shutdown) or Reboot the VM (graceful restart)
  3. Wait for the operation to complete
</Steps>
